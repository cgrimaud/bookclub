I am in a bookclub that has been reading and meeting since 2012. This website is a record of all of the books we've read as well as the date and location we met to discuss them. 

The books and details are placed into dynamically generated cards and can be minimally filtered based on button selection.

I created this website to practice jQuery, dynamically inserting elements into HTML, and working with a JSON array (also, because it's really cool to see our bookclub history!).

Future upgrades to this website could include transfering the book data to a NoSQL database.
