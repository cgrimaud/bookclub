# Book Club Website

I am in a book club that has been reading and meeting since 2012. This website is a record of all of the books we've read as well as the date and location we met to discuss them.

### To test this website:

The website is hosted on GitHub pages, so the easiest way to review it would be to [check it out here.](https://cgrimaud.github.io/bookclub/#). 


### What to expect:

I created this website to practice using bootstrap, jQuery, dynamically inserting elements into HTML, and working with a JSON array (also, because it's really cool to see our bookclub history!).

The books and details are placed into dynamically generated cards and can be minimally filtered based on genre selection from a drop-down menu. 

When the page first loads, you will see all of the book club books listed in cards. Each card contains an image of the book cover, the title, author, and the place & date we met. 

You can filter the books by selecting specific genres via the drop-down menu in the navbar.
